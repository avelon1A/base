# Android Base App

## Overview

This is a base Android application that serves as a starting point for developing Android applications. It includes a modular architecture using MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), Dependency Injection (with Hilt), Retrofit for network requests, Room for local database, Jetpack Compose for UI, and other modern Android development best practices.

## Features

- **MVVM Architecture**: Separation of concerns with ViewModel handling UI-related data.
- **Dependency Injection with Koitn**: Efficient dependency management across the app.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern declarative UI toolkit.
- **Room Database**: Local persistence for data storage.
- **ktor**: For RESTful API integration.
- **Flow**: For reactive data handling.
- **Coroutines**: For background operations and concurrency.
